    <h3>The Optimism Test</h3>
    <p>Read the description of each situation and vividly imagine it happening to you, even if
      it's never actually happened. Then read the two reasons for why this situation happened.
      Choose the cause more likely to apply to you. You may not like the way some of the responses
      sound, but don'''t choose what you <em>think</em> <em>you should say</em> or what would
      sound right to other people - choose the response you'd be likelier to have.</p>

        romantic partner breaks up with you, do you believe it's because you're unlovable or
        that no one understands you (i.e. a permanent state)? Or do you believe that you two just
        weren't a good match (a temporary state)? What about if you win the lottery? In this
        case, if you believe that you're a lucky person (i.e. a permanent state), that's optimistic
        compared to someone who thinks that they just got lucky with those numbers.</li>
      <li>Are bad experiences specific, or do they affect all parts of your life (i.e.
        <strong>pervasive</strong>)? For example, if you failed the math test, do you believe
        it's because you're not smart enough (i.e. a pervasive state), or is it because you're
        just not great at that subject (i.e. specific)?
      </li>
      <li>When bad things happen, do you blame yourself, or the circumstances
        (<strong>personalized</strong>)?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Pessimists tend to view bad events as permanent, pervasive, and personal. <em>When these
        habits are </em>out of balance<em> with optimistic thinking, our risk of experiencing
        depression and anxiety is higher. </em></p>

    <p>Certainly, some situations call for mild pessimism and some call for more optimism.
      Awareness
      of these situations and our thoughts is key. <strong>If you have any concerns about your
        scores, please follow-up with your primary healthcare provider for support!</strong></p>
